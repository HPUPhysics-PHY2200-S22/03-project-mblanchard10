    "1. finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the appropriate matrix and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the normal modes\n",
    "2. using the initial condition for the masses, $u_i(t=0)$, to solve for the coefficients and then writing the general solution for $u_i(t)$ as a sum of the normal modes\n",

    "- The application of the Momentum Principle is correct. It would be good to go the next step to develop the ODEs. Otherwise, there is no context for the mathematical calculations in the code.\n",
    "- I don't understand why you are specifiying initial conditions and calculating coefficients. You never use these because you only plot and animate the normal modes.\n",
    "- There are erroneous statements in the section \"Comparing Our Frequencies, Eigenvectors, and Coefficients\".\n",
    "- Eigenvectors are not made up of eigenfrequencies. Rather, an eigenvector is made up of the amplitudes of the displacement of each mass.\n",
    "- What is the purpose of the `animate2()` function? Did you use it.\n",
    "- You plot the first mode and animate it. Then under the section \"Plotting with different modes\" you plot it and animate it. I didn't understand why it's repeated. You should delete the first instance, since it came before the section heading.\n",
    "- Your code and calculations are all correct, but the narrative needs a lot of improvement. There are numerous erroneous statements.\n",
