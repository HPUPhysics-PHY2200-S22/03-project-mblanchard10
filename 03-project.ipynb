    "\n",
    "1. finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the appropriate matrix and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the normal modes\n",
    "2. using the initial condition for the masses, $u_i(t=0)$, to solve for the coefficients and then writing the general solution for $u_i(t)$ as a sum of the normal modes\n",
    "3. visualizing a normal mode $u_n(t) = a_n\\cos(\\omega_nt)$ using an animation\n",
    "4. visualizing the evolution of the system $u_i(t)$ using an animation\n",

    "## Project Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For a system of coupled oscillators, we defined the effective stiffness of the system $K$ and the mass of the system $M$. Then as we increased the number of masses $N$, we calculated the stiffness of an individual spring $k$ and mass of an individual ball $m$ in such a way that the effective stiffness and total mass remained the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a computational model to answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does changing the number of masses $N$ affect the fundamental frequency $\\omega_1$, the frequency of the first normal mode?\n",
    "2. Does changing the effective stiffness $K$ affect the fundamental frequency?\n",
    "3. Does changing the total mass $M$ affect the fundamental frequency?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not simply answer each question with \"yes\" or \"no.\" Rather, you should plot the variables you are investigating and use a curve fit to determine the functional relationship (if possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook `03-03-boundary-conditions.ipynb`, we investigated a system of coupled oscillators that were free on *both* ends. Instead, model a system of coupled oscillators that is fixed on the left end and free on the right end. You should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. find and visualize the normal modes\n",
    "2. use a starting shape $u_i(t=0)$ and model the time evolution of the system\n",
    "3. compare the results to the fixed-fixed and free-free cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the normal modes of a triatomic molecule with different masses (consider $\\rm{H}_2\\rm{O}$ or $\\rm{C}\\rm{O}_2$ for example). Compare your findings to the vibrational modes of the molecule found with IR spectroscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a theoretical calculation of the normal modes of a triatomic system with different masses and show that your numerical solution agrees with the theoretical calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 6.5 of *Computational Modeling and Visualization of Physical Systems with Python*, Jay Wang gives the wave equation for a string. This is a partial differential equation (PDE). While we modeled the string using coupled oscillators, he derives the PDE for a continuous string. Then he shows how to solve the PDE using the finite difference method (FDM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Section 6.5 and implement his code to solve the motion of a string that is fixed on both ends. Compare your results in notebook '03-04-matplotlib-animation.ipynb' where you modeled the string as 101 coupled oscillators with your results from Section 6.5 where you solve the PDE for the continuous string. Use the same initial condition for the string $u_i(x,t=0)$ in both cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you will have to choose the length, tension, and mass density for the continuous case such that you have the same fundamental frequency as the discrete case with values of $L$, $K$, and $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 5\n",
    "\n",
    "For a system of $N$ coupled oscillators fixed at both ends, show that solving the ODEs by numerical integration gives the same results for the evolution of the system as solving the ODEs by finding the normal modes and writing the general solution as a sum of the normal modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out this very cool paper on [Visualization of Wave Phenomena by an Array of Coupled Oscillators](visualization-of-wave-phenomena-by-an-array-of-coupled-oscillators.pdf) by G. Bischof, et al. Create a similar simulation in Python. See Section 6.7 of \\emph{Computational Modeling and Visualization of Physical Systems with Python} by J. Wang for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Do an experimental project. For example, we have a vibrating hoop where standing waves are created on the hoop for certain frequencies. This would be a very fun system to model too!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose your own project."
